# MDTP Contributor Guidelines

This page describes the process for contributing to the HMRC Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP). Every service or library on the MDTP is owned by a single team, in order to ensure no central repositories and/or teams constrain service delivery. Therefore this page is a description of the process for an individual or a team (the "Pull Requestor") to contribute a Pull Request for a repository (the "Repository") belonging to another team (the "Owning Team"). 

The contribution process is twofold: 
- MDTP Guidelines: uniform guidelines that apply to all repositories regardless of Pull Requestor, Owning Team, and Repository
- Repository Guidelines: contextual guidelines owned by the Owning Team for a specific Repository

It is the responsibility of both the Pull Requestor and Owning Team to follow these guidelines. If the Pull Requestor in particular does not follow these guidelines, it is highly likely the Owning Team will reject the changes and resist future Pull Requests from the Pull Requestor. 

It is important to remember that an Issue and a Pull Request is a placeholder for a conversation between the Pull Requestor and the Owning Team - people and interactions are important than processes and tools. The Pull Requestor should contact the Owning Team as soon as possible so that the Owning Team can indicate existing and in-progress Repository capabilities as well as an estimate of Pull Request lead time.

## MDTP Guidelines 

1. The Pull Requestor opens an Issue on the Repository and talks with the Owning Team about the proposed changes. 

## Repository Guidelines

Repository-specific guidelines from the Owning Team go here, if necessary.
