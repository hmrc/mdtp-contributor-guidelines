# MDTP Contributor Guidelines

This page describes the process for contributing to the HMRC Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP). 

Every service or library on the MDTP is owned by a single team, in order to ensure no central repositories and/or teams constrain service delivery. Therefore this page is a description of the process for an individual or a team (the "Pull Requestor") to issue a Pull Request on a repository (the "Repository") belonging to another team (the "Owning Team"). 

The contribution process is twofold: uniform MDTP Guidelines that apply to all repositories, and contextual Repository Guidelines that if specified apply to a single repository.

It is the responsibility of both the Pull Requestor and Owning Team to follow these guidelines. If the Pull Requestor does not follow these guidelines, it is highly likely the Owning Team will reject the changes and resist future Pull Requests from the Pull Requestor. 

## MDTP Guidelines 

1. The Pull Requestor opens an Issue on the Repository and talks with the Owning Team about the proposed changes

## Repository Guidelines

Repository-specific guidelines from the Owning Team go here, if necessary.
